Simulated Behavior: Mock APIs mimic the behavior of the real APIs that will be developed later. They respond to requests in a way that simulates the expected behavior, even though they do not perform any actual data processing or integration.

Rapid Prototyping: They enable rapid prototyping of applications that rely on the APIs, allowing developers and designers to create working models of the software before the APIs are fully implemented.

Stubs or Mocks: Mock APIs can be either stubs or mocks. Stubs return pre-defined responses and are often used to simulate the basic functionality of an API. Mocks, on the other hand, are more dynamic and can simulate various responses and behaviors, making them useful for testing different scenarios.

No Real Data Processing: Mock APIs do not perform any real data processing, database queries, or external integrations. Instead, they provide canned responses or predefined data, which can be useful for testing and development without affecting real systems.

Collaboration Tool: Mock APIs facilitate collaboration between different teams or stakeholders. Designers, frontend developers, and backend developers can start working on their parts of the system using the mock API as a common reference point.

Early Testing: They allow for early testing and validation of API design. By using mock APIs, you can identify design flaws, inconsistencies, and missing features before actual development begins.

Specification-Driven: Mock APIs are often built based on the API specification or contract, which is part of the API-First design approach. This ensures that the mock API closely follows the planned behavior of the actual API.

Flexible Responses: Mock APIs should be configurable to return various responses, such as success, error, or edge cases, to test how the consuming applications handle different scenarios.

HTTP Status Codes: They should accurately simulate HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error) to help with testing error handling and response interpretation.

Request Verification: Mock APIs may verify incoming requests to ensure that the client sends the expected parameters, headers, or authentication tokens, helping to enforce adherence to the API contract.

Documentation: Good mock APIs should be documented just like real APIs. This documentation should describe the available endpoints, request/response structures, and any special behaviors or limitations.

Dynamic Data Generation: For more advanced use cases, mock APIs can generate dynamic data, allowing you to test scenarios that involve changing data, such as pagination, sorting, or filtering.

Easily Replaceable: Mock APIs are designed to be easily replaceable with the real APIs once development is complete. This makes the transition from design to development relatively seamless.
