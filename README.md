# mockify
Mockify is an open-source, low-code solution that allows development teams to create and manage mock API endpoints.

## MotivationÂ 
Mocking APIs is a very important step in API-first design. Allow development teams frontend and backend to work in parallel. Instead of having backend developers finish endpoints first, frontend developers start with UI development activities. Backend developers or frontend developers can create mock API endpoints on mockify to speed up the development process and understand the business logic better.

## Mockify features:
- [ ] admin portal to manage uers, endpoints
- [ ] Mock response
- [ ] Mock complex business logic via NodeJS serverless functions.
- [ ] Mock common API endpoint functionalities like filteration and pagination, search.
- [ ] Validate request, response, and headers via NodeJS serverless functions using VineJS.
